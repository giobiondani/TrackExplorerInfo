<h1>Terms of Use</h1>

<p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 21, 2026</p>

<p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the TrackExplorer application ("App"), developed and provided by Giordano Biondani ("we", "us", or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

<h2>1. Nature of the App</h2>

<p>The App is provided solely for informational, reviewing, and planning purposes to help users reflect on and prepare for outdoor activities such as hiking, skiing, biking, or other adventures. It allows users to plan for activities in advance and review completed activities afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>The App is NOT intended for real-time use during activities.</strong></p>

<p>It is not designed, tested, or suitable for navigation, safety decisions, or real-time guidance while participating in outdoor activities. Users should never rely on the App for direction, timing, or safety while actually engaged in an activity. Appropriate real-time navigation tools, maps, guides, local knowledge, communication devices, and safety precautions must always be used in the field.</p>

<h2>2. Time and Route Estimates</h2>

<p>Any time estimates, elevation profiles, difficulty ratings, or other predictive information are generated for advance planning purposes only. These estimates use algorithms, and general assumptions. They are inherently approximate and do not account for real-world variables such as current weather, trail conditions, user fitness, group pace, equipment, fatigue, or unexpected obstacles. Actual times and experiences will vary — often significantly.</p>

<p><strong>YOU USE THE APP'S PLANNING AND REVIEW FEATURES AT YOUR OWN RISK.</strong> We are not responsible for any planning decisions, expectations, or post-activity interpretations based on information provided by the App.</p>

<h2>3. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your use of or inability to use the App for amy purposes</li>
  <li>Reliance on any time estimates or other planning/review information provided by the App</li>
  <li>Any bugs, errors, inaccuracies, data loss, corruption of saved plans or reviewed tracks, or failure of features</li>
  <li>Any injury, death, property damage, disappointment, or other harm — whether occurring before, during, or after an activity — that is claimed to relate (directly or indirectly) to use of the App</li>
  <li>Third-party services (maps, location data, etc.) integrated into the App</li>
</ul>

<p>The App is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, reliability, or uninterrupted operation.</p>

<p>Our total liability to you (if any) shall not exceed the amount you paid us for the App (which is zero if the App is free).</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>The App uses third-party map and location services (e.g., Azure Maps, Stadia Maps, OpenStreetMap, etc.). Your use of those services is governed by their own terms, which are linked in the App's attributions and legal notices. We are not responsible for their content, accuracy, availability, or terms.</p>

<h2>5. Changes to Terms</h2>

<p>We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms. The date at the top of this document will indicate when it was last updated.</p>

<h2>6. Governing Law</h2>

<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Colorado, United States, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

<h2>7. Contact</h2>

<p>If you have questions about these Terms, contact us at: info@trackexplorer.app</p>

<p>By using TrackExplorer, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms of Use.</p>
